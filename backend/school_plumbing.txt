This document describes the plumbing system for a typical school building. The system includes potable water supply, fixtures and appliances, drainage waste and vent (DWV) systems, and stormwater management.

Potable Water Supply System:
The potable water supply system consists of incoming water service from the municipal water main, backflow prevention device, water meter, pressure reducing valve, and distribution piping throughout the building to provide water to all fixtures and appliances. All materials used are lead-free and meet local codes and regulations.
Fixtures and Appliances:
Fixtures include sinks, toilets, urinals, drinking fountains, showers, eye wash stations, and laboratory equipment. All fixtures are selected based on ADA compliance, low flow rates, and water conservation standards. Appliances such as dishwashers, ice makers, and clothes washing machines are also provided with hot and cold water connections.
Drainage Waste and Vent (DWV) Systems:
The DWV system consists of sanitary and roof drains, vents, cleanouts, and traps designed to remove wastewater from fixtures and appliances while preventing sewer gases from entering the building. Materials used include PVC or cast iron pipes, fittings, and accessories.
Stormwater Management:
Stormwater management involves collecting rainwater runoff from rooftops and other impervious surfaces, conveying it through underground pipes, and disposing of it into an approved location. This may involve retention/detention ponds, swales, or other methods depending on local codes and regulations.
Maintenance and Inspection:
Regular maintenance and inspection of the plumbing system ensure its longevity and proper functioning. Routine tasks include checking for leaks, testing backflow preventers, inspecting fixtures and appliances, cleaning drains, and ensuring code compliance.
Emergency Procedures:
Emergency procedures should be established and communicated to staff members regarding responding to plumbing emergencies such as flooding, pipe bursts, or gas leaks. These procedures should include shutting off water supplies, contacting emergency responders, and notifying facilities personnel.
